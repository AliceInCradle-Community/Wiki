This monster will slowly slither towards the player whenever they enter its attack rangeï¼Œand attempt to damage them by either `pouncing` onto them or try to restrain them by `attaching` itself onto Noel's body at formidable `speed`. While weak on its own and can be easily disposed of, a swarm of them can easily overwhelm their target and corner them with the aforementioned `grabs` and `pounces`. Players can take them out safely with ground bombs and `white arrow` in the early game.
